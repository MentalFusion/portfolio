        <p>
            I'm a senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience building and scaling web platforms.
            Since 2017, I've led the development of a Vue 3 SPA for automation testing, working across the full stack
            with technologies like Node.js, Express.js, CouchDB, and TypeScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love clean code, thoughtful UI, and solving tough architectural problems. I also enjoy mentoring junior
            developers and learning emerging technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of work, you'll find me exploring New England with my family, tweaking home infrastructure projects,
            or diving into the occasional sci-fi novel.
